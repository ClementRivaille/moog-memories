# Moog Memories

Moog Memories is an interactive song where you add instruments, delay them, and apply effects. There is no other goal but to find pleasant arrangements and enjoying the melody. You can play it on [itch.io](https://itooh.itch.io/moog-memories).

It has been created with the HTML5 Web Audio API. Other resources helpful were [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io), [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [What Input](https://github.com/ten1seven/what-input).

This game was created for the [Music Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/musicgamejam). Since it has been made in 48 hours, there are some “shortcuts” in the code. I still added comments, so that you can learn a bit from it!

## Launch

```
npm install
npm start
```

This should start a server on localhost:8080 where the game can be played.
